# Important note for running on Windows 

If you get an error from running `sendpayment.exe` or `tumbler.exe` along the lines of "cannot find libsodium, tweetnacl" it means you don't have the VisualC++ redistributable. It can be downloaded from Microsoft [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784). Note: choose the x86 version.
