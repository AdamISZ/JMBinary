##OUT OF DATE AS OF Joinmarket 0.2.0, DO NOT USE

This may be reinstated in future, although there are other routes to usability, such as web interfaces that may be worth focusing on instead (in particular ways that do not involve using Joinmarket wallets). Those who want to work on this, note that the source is at the [`gui branch`](https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket/tree/gui).
