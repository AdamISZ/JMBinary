# JMBinary

Binary distributions of Joinmarket. This is a work in progress.

## GUI joinmarket app (for sendpayment only at the moment)

Executables can be found under:

* windows/joinmarket.exe
* ubuntu64/joinmarket-gui
* debian32/joinmarket-gui

No other files / setup should be needed.

For TAILS: use debian32 version, and run the executable with `torify joinmarket-gui`. You can set the irc onion host in the settings tab.

The github commit of these executables has been signed.
